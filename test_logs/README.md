## Stage Summaries

Detailed logs for each test category:

- **unit_tests.log**: Unit test execution details
- **integration_tests.log**: Integration test results
- **architecture_tests.log**: Architecture compliance validation
- **health_tests.log**: Health monitoring test results
- **performance_tests.log**: Performance benchmark results

## Log Retention

- Logs are rotated automatically
- Keep last 30 days of test cycles
- Coverage reports kept for last 10 runs
- Stage summaries archived monthly

## Usage

Logs are automatically generated when running:
```bash
python test.py --coverage
```

To view recent test results:
```bash
# View latest test cycle
tail -f test_logs/test_progress.log

# Check coverage
open test_logs/coverage_report.html

# Review specific stage
cat test_logs/stage_summaries/unit_tests.log
