# Actifix - Self-Improving Error Management Framework

> **The framework that tracks and improves itself.** 🚀  
> **Always read AGENTS.md before making changes.**

Actifix is a self-improving error management framework that captures rich context, prioritizes issues, and produces AI-ready tickets. It can even watch its own codebase, generate tickets for its own problems, and guide fixes through AI copilots.

## What Actifix Offers

- 🎯 **Production-grade capture**: Priority classification (P0–P4), duplicate guards, atomic writes, fallback queues, and secret redaction out of the box.
- 📦 **Drop-in usage**: Pure-stdlib Python package—import it, call `enable_actifix_capture()`, and start recording tickets immediately.
- 🧠 **AI-native**: Generates remediation notes, normalized context, and 200k-token-friendly bundles for Claude, GPT, or any LLM.
- 🔁 **Self-improvement mode**: Actifix watches its own development, opening tickets against itself as you code.
- 🗂️ **Transparent artifacts**: SQLite ticket database (`data/actifix.db`), error rollups (`ACTIFIX.md`), and lifecycle logs (`AFLog.txt`).
- 🛠️ **Configurable by environment**: Tune data/state directories, context capture limits, and capture enablement with env vars—no code changes needed.

## How It Works (Lifecycle)

1) **Capture**: `enable_actifix_capture()` installs the global hooks; `record_error(...)` ingests an exception with stack trace, file context, and system state.  
2) **Normalize**: Secret redaction, priority inference, duplicate guard hashing, and optional manual priority override.  
3) **Persist**: Ticket Markdown and logs written atomically to the data/state directories, with fallback queues to avoid loss.  
4) **Dispatch (planned)**: `DoAF` ticket processor will route items for AI/automation, dedupe, and mark completion.  
5) **Improve**: Self-development mode raises tickets against Actifix itself, keeping the framework honest and continually improving.

## Feature Breakdown

- **Error intelligence**: Auto-priority (P0–P4), deduplication, remediation hints, and stack/file/system snapshots.  
- **Reliability guards**: Atomic writes, fallback queues, normalized paths, and configurable storage roots for container, server, or local use.  
- **Security by default**: Secret redaction for API keys, passwords, and PII before anything is persisted.  
- **AI readiness**: Compact, consistent context suitable for large-context models; remediation notes tailored for copilots.  
- **Self-development**: Bootstrap once and Actifix tracks its own regressions, milestones, and open work.  
- **Zero-dependency core**: Uses Python stdlib only—easy to embed anywhere.

## Quick Start

### Install / Import
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmanldn/actifix.git
cd actifix
# Pure stdlib; no pip install required to start using the framework
```

> `python start.py` now watches `pyproject.toml` once per minute and restarts the static frontend server automatically when the project version changes so the UI refreshes after pushes.

### Capture Your First Error
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
import actifix

actifix.enable_actifix_capture()  # install the capture hooks

try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    actifix.record_error(
        message=str(e),
        source='my_module.py:42',
        run_label='my-application',
        error_type=type(e).__name__,
        capture_context=True,  # include file/system context
    )
```

### Turn On Self-Development Mode
```python
import actifix

actifix.bootstrap_actifix_development()  # installs handlers and creates scaffold
actifix.create_initial_ticket()
actifix.track_development_progress(
    "New feature completed",
    "Implemented advanced error tracking"
)
```

### Inspect Tickets
```bash
sqlite3 data/actifix.db "SELECT id, priority, status, message, run_label FROM tickets ORDER BY
    CASE priority WHEN 'P0' THEN 0 WHEN 'P1' THEN 1 WHEN 'P2' THEN 2 WHEN 'P3' THEN 3 ELSE 4 END,
    created_at DESC LIMIT 30;"
cat actifix/ACTIFIX.md        # rollup of the last 20 errors
tail -n 50 actifix/AFLog.txt  # lifecycle log for debugging capture
```

## Core API Surface

- `enable_actifix_capture()`: Install global exception handling and capture hooks.  
- `record_error(message, source, run_label, error_type, priority=None, capture_context=False)`: Persist a ticket with optional priority override and context capture.  
- `bootstrap_actifix_development()`: Enable Actifix to track its own development lifecycle.  
- `track_development_progress(title, detail)`: Log milestones as tickets.  
- `create_initial_ticket()`: Seed the project with a starter ticket in self-development mode.

See `src/actifix/` for implementation details: `raise_af.py` (capture engine), `bootstrap.py` (self-development), and `state_paths.py` (state management).

## Raise_AF Ticketing Requirement

All work must begin by logging the condition through `actifix.raise_af.record_error(...)` so a structured row lands in `data/actifix.db` with the proper priority and context (the legacy Markdown list is retired). Files such as `TASK_LIST.md` or `Actifix-list.md` no longer exist—the SQLite store and associated APIs are the only writable task registry. This keeps the RaiseAF ticketing workflow as the single source of truth and keeps the AI/automation pipeline honest. Enforcement is active: set `ACTIFIX_CHANGE_ORIGIN=raise_af` (default enforced) or operations will fail fast.

## Configuration (Environment Variables)

- `ACTIFIX_CAPTURE_ENABLED`: Enable/disable capture (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`, `debug`).  
- `ACTIFIX_CHANGE_ORIGIN`: Must be `raise_af` when enforcement is on (default).  
- `ACTIFIX_ENFORCE_RAISE_AF`: Set to `0` only for emergency bypass (default `1`).  
- `ACTIFIX_DATA_DIR`: Data directory for tickets (default `./actifix`).  
- `ACTIFIX_STATE_DIR`: State directory (default `./.actifix`).  
- `ACTIFIX_FILE_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS`: File context length (default `2000`).  
- `ACTIFIX_SYSTEM_STATE_MAX_CHARS`: System state length (default `1500`).

## Usage Patterns

- **Production monitoring**: Enable capture in your app entrypoint; let Actifix classify and dedupe, then pull Markdown tickets into your ops workflow.  
- **Developer safety net**: Keep capture on in local/dev; Actifix auto-opens tickets for regressions and flaky behaviors while you work.  
- **AI-assisted debugging**: Feed the ticket Markdown (with remediation notes) to your copilot for suggested fixes.  
- **Self-hosted improvement**: Run `bootstrap_actifix_development()` inside this repo; Actifix will ticket its own issues while you add features.

## Roadmap Snapshot

- ✅ Core capture, state management, bootstrap/self-development, Markdown artifacts, basic tests.  
- 🚧 In progress: DoAF ticket processor, validation framework, richer AI context.  
- 🗺️ Planned: Health monitoring, circuit breakers, retry/notification system, telemetry, AI integrations, web dashboard.

## Testing & Demo

```bash
# Basic tests
ACTIFIX_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1 python3 -m pytest test/test_actifix_basic.py -v

# Self-improvement demo (creates tickets against the framework itself)
python3 test/test_actifix_basic.py
